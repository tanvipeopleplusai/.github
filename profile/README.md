## INTRODUCTION
People+AI is a community of doers, dreamers, tinkerers & innovators who believe in the power of ai for the people. Powered by the folks behind most of Indiaâ€™s DPI efforts, the team behind People+AI has a proven track record of building technology in the service of humanity. 

People+AI is trying to create a future by DESIGN. We want to evolve technology in service of humanity and not the other way round. We believe that ai will allow fundamental paradigm shifts to take place in India:
- [ ] Voice first: Indians will access digital & intelligence through their voice. This needs a capable multi-modal Indian language AI ecosystem. 
- [ ] Listen at scale: Governance will go from top-down to bottom-up because AI can enable 1:1 conversations at scale. 
- [ ] +ai talent: Nurture talent for an AI World. This means reskilling, new-skills, new jobs and talent communities using AI to access new opportunities within & outside India.
